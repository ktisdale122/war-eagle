Error Logs Aggregator
Read the log files for error messages. ​
Usually, all log files will have a log-level:- INFO, DEBUG, ERROR etc.​
You are provided with a log file (application.log) which contains many errors and information or debug statements.​
Let's look out for those log-level and focus on ERROR logs specifically and write those sentences to a different file called _error.log file.​
The output _error.log will have only the error logs from the file we read.​
