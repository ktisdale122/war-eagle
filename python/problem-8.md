practice_sorting_list_tuples_v1
You will be provided with a Colour frequency list which is a list of tuples.
You are required to sort it without using any in built functions for sorting.​
The tuple has the color name and the frequency number. You need to sort with the frequency number alone.
​
There is a file with list of tuples provided for you to take as input.
like:-  list = [("black",4),("green", 1),("red", 5), ("blue", 2), ("yellow",6), ("voilet", 2)].​
Replace the colour_frequency = [] with one of the list provided in the text file.
Your solution should work for all such list options.
