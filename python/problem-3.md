practice_filter_prime_numbers_function_v1
Create a program to traverse a list of numbers and print all the prime numbers in the list. Create a function to validate the numbers to be prime numbers.
Use solution_inputs.txt to get the sample list of numbers.
Your function that you create should be able to validate against all of those list.
The boiler plate contains list_num = [].
Replace the  [] and test your solution against each of those given list and then submit your solution.
