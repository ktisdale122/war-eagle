challenge_battle_royale_v1
In this challenge, we will be creating a Battle Royale game, which is an individual or team-based game, where we target at eliminating our enemies and the last man or team standing wins the game.
This version of our game has 20 players, of which 3 are in your team. And you cannot kill your team members.
Your 3 team members are selected randomly and added to your team at the beginning of the game.
You kill your enemy by entering their player number, and the players health decrease by 20 health points (HP). Once it reaches 0, the person will be removed from that team.
Shoot until your team remains. If you shoot your team member it returns a message stating "You cannot hit your team member."
In one turn, you get to shoot the enemy and the enemy will shoot at you back or your team members. The player who is shot in your team will lose 4 HP. When you shoot your enemy, he will be losing 20 HP. The player from your team who will be shot will be picked randomly.
The game continues until

All players in the opposition die,
You die.
