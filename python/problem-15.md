Practice - File Rename Command
Your organization has 50 offices all over the country. All the data generated by various applications developed by your organization flows into a server. The files reaching the server do not have creation time appended to their names, due to which we are not able to locate what all data was generated at any specific date or time.
Thus, we need a pipeline using which the files will get renamed and the creation date/time will get appended to their names before they are placed into storage.
The first step is to create a rename command that would help us rename the files accordingly.


For the files without extensions, the command will rename and append the creation date/time to the file names.

For example: new-filename_2021-05-24:21:42:34.532139



For the files with extensions, the command will get the creation date/time appended to their names followed by the file extension.

For example: new-filename_2021-05-24:21:42:34.532139.log



Write a Python script to create the rename command.
Example 1:
If the command was run at 2021-05-24 21:42:34.532139:[O[I

[200~Example 2:
If the command was run at 2021-05-24 21:42:34.532139
