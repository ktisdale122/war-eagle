practice_matrix_addition_v1
Write a program to add two matrices. You should ask the user to input the dimensions of the matrices and the values in it.
The program should perform the following tasks:

Create the function matrix_input() to get the size of matrices and the values in it.
Create the function matrix_add(matrix_1, matrix_2) which add the two matrices and returns the resultant matrix.
Print the resultant matrix.

Print the matrix in its normal format. Like matrix of dimensions (3,2) will be like this:-
