# Practice - Working With the Python Interpreter​

# Exercises List 

Try these operations in the Python interpreter shell and update the result in the CSV sheet. 

## Exercise 1

Get the output of the following arithmetic operations:

- 40 – 43 
- 85 / 25 
- 85 // 25 
- 16 ** 4 
- 85 % 5 
- 20 / 2 
- 31 * 2

## Exercise 2

Perform the following assignments: 

- assign value 1 to variable a 
- assign value 2.4 to variable b 
- assign your name to a variable “name” 
- assign True to variable “check” 
- Simultaneously assign value 23 to variables a, b, and c 

Enter the executed expressions in the CSV sheet.

## Exercise 3

For the given data types, create and assign various values to the appropriate variables: 

- Integer 
- Float 
- Boolean 
- String 

Enter the executed expressions in the CSV sheet.  

## Exercise 4

Try executing the following expressions: 

- var1 = 2 
- 2var = 2 
- var_1 = 2 
- var$2 = 2 

If the expression executes successfully, enter the executed expression in the CSV sheet. 

If the expression does not execute successfully, enter the error message and explain why.

## Exercise 5

Try executing the following expressions:  

- Class = 15 
- class = 14 
- DEF = 13 
- def = 12 

If the expression executes successfully, enter the executed expression in the CSV sheet and explain whether it follows the naming rules. 

If the expression does not execute successfully, enter the error message and explain why. 

## Exercise 6

Assign your name, age, gender, and description to four different variables. The variables should follow all the appropriate naming rules. 

If the expressions execute successfully, enter the four expressions obtained in the CSV sheet. 

If the expressions do not execute successfully, enter the error message and explain why.

## Exercise 7

For the following expressions, identify the data type of the results:

- "Hello" + "World"
- "John" * 2
- 1 + "2"
- "2" + "1"
- "True" + "False"
- True + True
- True + False
- False + False
- 8 / 3

Use the function type() to identify the data type of the result. E.g.: type(2 +2), type(“John” + “ Doe”)

This provides the data type of the resultant value. Enter the datatype for each expression in the CSV sheet. If the expression does not execute successfully, enter the error message and explain why.

## Exercise 8

Evaluate the following expressions and identify whether the result is True or False.

Part 1: Assign a = 12 and b = 23. Now check:
- a > b

Part 2: Update a = 24, b remains same. Now check:
- a == a
- a != a

Part 3: Update a = 5 and b = 6. Now check:
- a-b <= b-a
- a-b >= b-a

Enter the output  in the CSV sheet.

## Exercise 9

Evaluate the following expressions and identify whether the results are True or False.

- 2 == 2.0
- 15 == 15.01
- 15 <= 15.01
- 21 != 21.0

Enter the output in the CSV sheet.

## Exercise 10

Evaluate the following expressions and identify whether the results are True or False.

Create two variables a and b with values 10 and 15 respectively. Now check:

- a > 5 and 5 > b
- a > 5 or 5 > b
- not a > b

Update the values of a = True and b = False. Now check:

- a and b
- a or b
- not b

## Exercise 11

Evaluate the following expressions and confirm the data type of the results. Use the "is" and "is not" operator to validate the results with the expected data type.

| Expression  | Expected Data Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| "John" + "Doe"  | str |
| "Catch" * 2 |	str |
| "2" + "1"	| str |
| "True" + "False" | str |
| True + True |	int |
| 8 / 3	| float |
| 5 >3 | bool |

## Exercise 12

Evaluate the following expression and identify whether the results are True or False.

- "Two" in "One Two Three"
- "1" in "1,2,3"
- "True" not in "False has a value 0"

## Exercise 13

Create an expression to calculate the area of a circle. Use the radius value as 2.

Enter the executed expression in the CSV sheet.

## Exercise 14

Evaluate the following expression using x = 3.4.

- 2x\*x\*x + 5x\*x + 8x - 10

## Exercise 15

Solve the given expressions following the rules of operator precedence. Solve it on paper first. Then compare your results with the output from the Python interpreter.

Evaluate the following expressions:

- c \* e + f - g 
- d / b \* b + d - a
- f \* e - c \* e / b / b
- e / c \*\* b + d - a
- h \*\* e / d \*\* c

Enter the expression showing the order of operation in the CSV sheet.

Eg:- c \* a + c \* k – n => ( ( (c \* a) + (c \* k) ) - n )
