Objective: Learn modularization by refactoring a God Code
In this challenge, you are required to refactor a program that creates a shopping cart to accept customer purchases. A developer coded this program as a first version to be shown as proof of concept so it is basically a God Program right now.
The program covers three basic operations:

Add items to the shopping cart, if they are available.
Ask the shopper for his or her delivery address.
Calculate the bill amount for all items.


Part 1
You need to understand the program logic and refactor the program to a good quality code.
What defines a good quality code?

Code is readable with properly defined comments.
Code is modular with logical functions performing at most a single operation.
Lines is Code is reduced by reducing repetitive code.

An attribute of good programmers is that they write good quality code.
The boilerplate provided has the code for the shopping cart program. Refactor this program to have good quality code.
Submit your updated program with filename: solution_shopping_cart_godprogram_refactor_part1.py

Part 2
Shopping is not complete until you get a bill. Once the code is refactored in Part 1, you need to add a feature to generate the bill for the purchased items. Create the necessary functions to generate the bill.
The objective is to achieve the addition of a new feature with minimal changes to your previous code. This shows how well you have defined the functions in code.
Save your code to a new file as given below. Update the code to include the new feature.
Submit your updated program with filename:
solution_shopping_cart_godprogram_refactor_part2.py
Expected Bill Output Format:
