Practice - List files & dirs commands
Previously, we have learned about the ls command in the Linux OS. Now, we will try to understand the back picture of it and learn how the command executes. For this, we will try to replicate the functionality of the ls command by creating two new commands: lf and ld.

Part 1:
Write a Python script to implement the Linux command lf to return all the files present in the current working directory.

Part 2:
Write a Python script to implement the Linux command ld to return all the directories present in the current working directory.:wq
