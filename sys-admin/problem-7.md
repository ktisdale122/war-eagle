# Practice: Managing Files and Directory Permission

## Practice Exercise 1: Create Partition and Mounting
​
System admin needs to create two new partitions of 1GB respectively. Both of these partitions should not be the primary partitions. Set filesystem to ext3. Mount them in the /Sale and /Finance directories.​

## Practice Exercise 2: Set Advance Linux Permission​

In a company, there are two users – ‘John’ and ‘Cindy’. They are members of the  ‘Sales Group’. John is the group administrator. Both users can read, write and execute commands on Folder X. Every member of the Sales Group can create and delete files within the directory of Folder X.​

Cindy can delete files created by John and vice-versa.​

This can cause trouble in future. Demonstrate how we can fix this issue.​
​
## Practice Exercise 3: Need to set SetGID**​

In Phoenix Corp, John and Cindy work in the sales department.  The system admin has created a Sales Folder for the sales department. The admin has given the read, write and execute permission and given group ownership to the sales department. John has recently created a file named John112. Now, the ownership of the file has change to John. The admin is facing issues because the ownership should remain as sales and should not been given to either John or Cindy. ​
