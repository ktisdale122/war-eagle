# Problem Statement

## Instruction: For exercise 4,5,6 and 7 use the vagrant files given in the respective folders.

## Exercise 01 - Converting Decimal to Binary

Convert the given decimal numbers to binary numbers: 
- 28 
- 47 
- 53 
- 109 
- 247 

The solution of this exercise will be the binary equivalent of the given decimal numbers. 

## Exercise 02 - Identifying Network IDs

Pair the valid PCs based on their network ids  
- 192.168.2.128/25 
- 192.168.1.30/22 
- 192.168.5.0/16 
- 192.168.6.64/16 
- 192.168.1.110/22 
- 192.18.6.32/8 
- 192.168.8.64/24 
- 192.168.8.4/24 
- 192.20.6.128/8 
- 192.168.2.1/25 
The solution for this exercise will be pair valid Network PCs.

## Exercise 03 - Calculating Subnet Mask

Given are the IP addresses, write the Subnet Mask for each: 
- 192.168.2.130/25 
- 192.168.2.13/23 
- 192.168.2.10/24 
- 192.168.2.204/23 
The solution for this exercise will be  subnet mask values asked to be calculated. 

## Exercise 04 - Configuring IP address

Configure a CentOS-7 machines PC1  and PC2 to be a part of a network N1 with id 192.168.2.0/24 with any IP addresses reside in the network using nmtui.  
- Check the IP was configured.  
- Verify the connectivity 

The solution for this exercise will be a screenshot showing the configured IP as the output of the verification command. 

## Exercise 05 - Configuring default Gateway IP

Perform the following configurations. 
- Confirm PC1 and PC2 are unable to connect to the internet by pinging to the public IP address 8.8.8.8
- Add the IP of machine G1 i.e., 192.168.2.10 as the default gateway for the machine PC1 and PC2. 
- Verify that  the internet is accessed only via Gateway  

Note: The machines PC1 and PC2 should be able to communicate with the internet. Verify the communication with the help of a ping command.  
The solution for this exercise will be two screenshots showing the internet connectivity of the machines PC1 and PC2 via gateway G1 

## Exercise 06 - View IP routing table

You are provided with a Linux system that is connected to a network S1 over ethernet interface eth1 and to the internet over ethernet interface eth0. Write the commands to perform the following tasks: 
- View all IPv4 IP addresses. 
- Check the routing table 
- Delete the default path to internet 
- Verify the connectivity with the internet. 

The solution of this exercise will be the commands to execute the given processes. 

## Exercise 07 - Manual IP Configuration

- Configure the IP address 192.168.1.10 to PC on interface enps03 using IP command. 
- Verify the assigned IP address 

The solution for this exercise will be a screenshot showing the configured IP as the output of the verification command.
